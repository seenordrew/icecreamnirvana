		<p>I remember the day clearly when I first came upon such a mad experiment of science.  After stepping out of the dry Arizona heat and into the cool purveyor of fine dairy sweets, I looked inside the freezer to see what flavors were on display, only to find what might be something radical enough to bring together the most fiery of enemies.  “What?  Goat cheese flavored...ice cream?  Certainly it could not be.  Goat cheese...in ice cream?  I...I need to sit down.”<br><br>

But, alas, my weary legs that had just driven for five hours proclaimed, “Nay, my good man!  Ye must tempt fate and provoke the gods of flavor by embarking on this most daring adventure.”<br><br>

And thus, I turned to the attendant and decreed, “My lady!  I shall try this concoction you call goat cheese, walnut honey ice cream.”  As our eyes met, I felt instantly that she too knew this was the right choice.  It was all too obvious when she replied, “Okay.”<br><br>

She retrieved a tasting spoon.  Not any regular spoon...no.  A spoon she had clearly selected just for me, specifically for this occasion.  She scooped a sample and upon passing the spoon to me the electricity in the room began dancing.  She could barely contain her emotions as she said, “Here ya go.”<br><br>

Just as the conductor prepares the orchestra with a swift raising of the baton, I had my first taste of this madness.  Oh, the flavor!  Oh, the richness! Oh, the balance of the soft-flavored goat cheese with the crunchy walnuts and the sweet honey!  It was all there: frozen to the optimum temperature, full-bodied texture, not overloaded with sugar...my decision was made.<br><br>

“M'lady!  Ye have graced me with such a noble flavor. Please, was I request a full scooping of thine creation?  Enough to fill a small cup of the paper variety?”<br><br>

If only you could have seen the ecstatic joy, the abundant life in her eyes as she said, “Sure.”  The conductor had started the prelude of the grand symphony, but only now was the masterful melody truly going to begin.  She passed me the cup of ice cream, this time with an even more spectacular spoon – pink plastic – and the harmony of the strings, the singing of the horns, the crashing of the percussion all possessed the room.<br><br>  

What a flavor, such smoothness, the mad experiment had paid off, and Churn Creamery had solved the riddle of how to turn goat cheese into world-class ice cream.</p><br>
